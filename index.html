                <h1>Hello kitty's story</h1>
                <p>Born in 1974 by the hand of the designer Yuko Shimizu, it is characterized by a red bow above the left ear (sometimes
                the bow is replaced by a five-petaled flower or both are present, more rarely she wears other accessories) and the
                absence of the mouth, except for the animated series, in which the mouth is visible. Her full name is Kitty White (name
                inspired by the cat Kitty from the fantasy book Through the Looking Glass), she is English and lives in London, she is
                of the sign of Scorpio, she loves apple pies, she has a twin sister, she attends the third grade, so she is about 8
                years old.
                A universe of puppets with childish features revolves around the character of Hello Kitty. Created in 1974 in Tokyo and
                registered in 1976, Hello Kitty is currently a very strong brand, generating an annual turnover of $1 billion[3] through
                a varied merchandising, much of which is licensed, which every year sees the offers multiply through a wide variety of
                products.</p>

                <h1>Teory about her</h1>
                <p>Hello Kitty, a popular character, has been the subject of several conspiracy theories over the years. One such theory is
                that Hello Kitty is a human girl, not a cat. Sanrio corrected this statement in an article for the Los Angeles Times,
                which was published on August 26, 2014. An anthropologist from the University of Hawaii, Christine R. Yano, described
                Hello Kitty as a cat, but Sanrio corrected her, resulting in the Los Angeles Times article.
                
                However, many interpreted the statement as literal, leading to the idea that Hello Kitty is a human girl with her
                cat-like features being an aesthetic design choice. The name Kitty is a real, although passé diminutive for the name
                Katherine, which would imply that Hello Kitty's full, legal name is Katherine George White.
                
                The controversy surrounding Hello Kitty's true nature became widespread, leading to calls from RocketNews24 and Kotaku.
                Sanrio's Japanese PR representative clarified that Hello Kitty was a gijinka (anthropomorphic) cat, similar to Mickey
                Mouse, and that Disney's mascot character is not mistaken for a human but not quite a mouse either.
                
                Online publication Kotaku also called Sanrio's Tokyo headquarters to have the question answered, and a representative
                responded that Hello Kitty was done in the motif of a cat, making it difficult to say that Hello Kitty is not a cat.</p>
